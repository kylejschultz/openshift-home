# Openshift At Home
_Documentation and manifests for my local home lab, currently running OKD._
<br><br><br><br>

## Overview
I am creating a home-lab Openshift based using OKD. Currently, this cluster will be running in a single node and is very much a work in progress. This repo will hold setup and configuration documentation, as well as serve as my storage for manifests that I am applying to the cluster once it's up and running.
